1.) for Server:		package mygame.server;
	for Utilities:	package mygame.shared;
	for Client:		package mygame.client;
2.) the development directory—let's call it "sources"—needs a "mygame" subdirectory with its own subdirectories
	Server.Java belongs in sources/mygame/server
	Utilities.Java belongs in sources/mygame/shared
	Client.java belongs in sources/mygame/client
3.) the source files would then need import statements if they rely on members of the other newly created packages
	e.g. if Client relies on Server, then the Client.java file would need: import mygame.server.Server or import mygame.server.*;
