	<p>The <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast SEO plugin page</a> also uses the meta tag to provide a description that shows up well in search engines. I linked to this page because I didn't previously know the specifics on how the Yoast plugin was able to modify search engine result listings for a WordPress site to match user-defined text. Once I read this section, I connected the link, and it makes a little more sense now.</p>
