assignment:
When imagining your own site, imagine the site has this functionality: Its purpose is to help the user test their knowledge of a topic they choose. The user will be able to enter a question, and its associated answers. How many ways can somebody create a question? Single Choice.. Multiple Choice.. What else? The questions can be categorized in some way. Keywords would be a way of putting a question in a given category. The user can search for questions that fall in a given category, and get an exam based on those questions.

common to every page:
- header :
	-> logo
	-> tagline / brief description
	-> navigation
	-> quick jumping off point to generated exams or question categories
- footer : 
	-> navigation
	-> social media links
	-> back to top button

 - footer at bottom:
