	<p>Certain special characters have reserved meanings or uses in HTML and cannot always be used on their own in an HTML file.  They can, however, be displayed using what's called "character references". A character reference is a sequence of characters that starts with an ampersand or &amp;, is filled with a code of alpha-numeric characters, and ends with a semicolon.</p>
	<p>A couple example character references (aka entity references):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A &apos;&lt;&apos; or &quot;less than character&quot; can be displayed with a character reference of <strong>&amp;lt;</strong></li>
		<li>A &apos;&gt;&apos; or &quot;greater than character&quot; can be displayed with a character reference of <strong>&amp;gt;</strong></li>
	</ul>
