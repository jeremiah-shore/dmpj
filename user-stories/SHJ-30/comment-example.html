	Funny story... in high school I had a web design class that used a very dated curriculum, around the time of web 2.0, or a couple years before. The entire class was in Microsoft FrontPage 2002, and it was 2005 at the time. The projects we were working on were verbatim DO THIS, DO THAT, CLICK HERE, etc. type exercises; pretty boring and non-challenging stuff. I made the smart decision to copy and submit one of my classmate's projects—with his permission, of course—so I could have more free time to do whatever I wanted during class. Turns out, I forgot to remove the HTML comment with his name in it. I got caught, and this was the only C final letter grade I ever got in high school.

	Years later, I've built and maintained several small websites, some of them on a freelance basis. I've never forgotten, however, the importance comments can have in certain cases. 

	;)
